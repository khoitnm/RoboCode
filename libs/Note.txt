robocode.jar can be got in the home folder where you install RoboCode game:
${ROBOCODE_HOME}/libs/robocode.jar

Note: I have to use this approach to include it into my project because that dependencies doesn't exist in Maven repository.
It's just 182 kB, so it's safe to be committed into Git repository.
