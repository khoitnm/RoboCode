Diamond is a former Melee champion, now ranked #2 in both General 1v1 and
Melee. It's about as good as they get. In 1v1, it loses to only one bot
(DrussGT), and only scores below 60% (as in 3:2) against 3 other bots. In Melee,
it doesn't lose to anyone, but roughly ties with the other two strongest bots.

Scores are as of August 9, 2015. Current scores: http://literumble.appspot.com
